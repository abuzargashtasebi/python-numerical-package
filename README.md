# python-numerical-package

This package includes Python codes covering mostly numerical methods. Although there are some other subjects such as statistics, signal processing, and geometrical programs. 
It has been tried to the pure Python code and not other libraries, but in some areas for the sake of simplicity using some basic Python libraries such as NumPy is inevitable.
